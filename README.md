`gst.wasm` is a GStreamer port to WebAssembly. Its main goal is to implement the support of WebAssembly
in GStreamer (and its dependencies) and bring the changes upstream. This repository is a placeholder to
keep up-to-date information required on how to build, develop, and deploy GStreamer in a browser or in
a `node.js` runtime environment until all the information is finally merged into the corresponding
projects.
